# Subgraph Isomorphism

❄Implement the common subgraph isomorphism algorithms (i.e. Ullmann, VF2) based on `MapReduce` on `Hadoop`.

## What's subgraph isomorphism problem?

In theoretical computer science, the subgraph isomorphism problem is a computational task in which two graphs G and H are given as input, and one must determine whether G contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to H.

## the UML of Implementation of SubGraph Isomorphism Algorithms

 the encapsulation and optimization of the Ullmann algorithm and the VF2 algorithm are carried out. The UML as follow:
