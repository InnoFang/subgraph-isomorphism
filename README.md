# Subgraph Isomorphism

Design and implement the common subgraph isomorphic algorithm based on `MapReduce` programming model on `Hadoop` platform

## What's subgraph isomorphism problem?

In theoretical computer science, the subgraph isomorphism problem is a computational task in which two graphs G and H are given as input, and one must determine whether G contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to H. [1]
