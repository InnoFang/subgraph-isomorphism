<h3>Dataset information</h3>
<p>Arxiv GR-QC (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology) collaboration network is from the e-print <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> and covers scientific collaborations between authors papers submitted to General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology category. If an author <i>i</i> co-authored a paper with author <i>j</i>, the graph contains a undirected edge from <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>. If the paper is co-authored by <i>k</i> authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on <i>k</i> nodes.</p>
<p>The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents essentially the complete history of its GR-QC section.</p>
