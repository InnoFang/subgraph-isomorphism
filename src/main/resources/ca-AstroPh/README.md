## Dataset information

Arxiv ASTRO-PH (Astro Physics) collaboration network is from the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors papers submitted to Astro Physics category. If an author i co-authored a paper with author j, the graph contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the paper is co-authored by k authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on k nodes.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents essentially the complete history of its ASTRO-PH section.
